This repository contains a commented python code for the OSPREY smart worksheet. 
The code is designed to function with minimal user editing. 
A triple hash (###) indicates a region of code where the user can change certain features, such as a question to be asked or a given answer.
Searching for ### is therefore the quickest way to edit the smart worksheet.
A sample lab script and pre-lab video are also provided to suppor the practical session.
