# This code was produced by Dr Sam Perry from University of Southampton Department of Chemistry
# I hope you find this code useful! 
# The Github folder contains how to guides on how to edit the code in order to create your own smart worksheet.
# Start with the master code segment, then add in the various types of question that you would like to include to build up the worksheet
# The master document contains a number of built in functions that are able to record student responses, calculate correct answers, record grades and provide feedback.
# There are also separate question codes, that contain sample codes for how to ask certain types of questions based on the desired response. These include:
    # - Submission of a single value without grading
    # - Submission of a single value with grading against a given answer
    # - Submission of a single value with grading against a value calculated by the worksheet
    # - Checkbox answers where student click the box next to the correct answer
    # - Submission of a range of answers within the same question, with grading against given answers
    # - Submission of a range of answers within the same question, with grading values calculated by the worksheet 
    # - Plotting of scatter plots with associated regression analysis
    # - Plotting a line plot with peak finding and integration capabilities
# As you are building your worksheet, copy the relevant question type into the questions section of the master document
# The only areas you need to edit are marked by the ### symbols (only three # in a row. Single # are coding comments designed to assist users interested in the Python code)
# You can therefore use the find function in your code editor to search for ###, and edit the associated sections.
# Edit the sections next to the ### symbol to alter question text, answers, and formualas used to calculate values. The code will do the rest!
# Good luck and enjoy!!

Work through the questions below one at a time and hit submit when ready. If your answer is correct, the worksheet will award full marks. If not, a point penalty will be applied and you will receive some feedback on how best to tackle common errors."# \n\n The answers should be completed one at a time in order. Do not skip questions. Some questions will depends on previous answers, and so skipping questions may cause errors to be carried forwards and will lose you marks. \n\n You may take as many attempts as you wish to submit a correct answer. You may also select solve to have the answer given to you. In this case the answer will be revealed and a score of zero awarded for that question. \n\n Be aware that the worksheet is sensitive to the format of your answers, particularly to decimal places and significant figures. To access the highest marks, pay attention to the following: \n\n Unless otherwise stated, all answers should be given to 3 significant figures (3 s.f.). For example, ùúã would be reported as 3.14. \n\n For very small numbers, powers may be represented using e-n to mean x10‚Åª‚Åø, although decimals will be accepted as well. An acceptable decreasing sequence could be 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 1e-05, 1e-06. Note that the format is 1e-05, not 1e-5 nor 1 e-05. \n\n Numbers that meet multiple of these conditions should follow all rules For example 1.2300004 x 10\u207B\u2075 should be reported to 3 s.f. as 1.23e-05 \n\nAs an extra note, there is a strange querk with the worksheet that sometimes the scrollbar does not let you scroll all the way to the botom. If this happens, maximise, unmaximise, and then maximise the window, and the scrollbar will return to normal."

So, at this point all of the copper is in the form of Cu¬≤‚Å∫. You then sweep to the left and get a negative peak, which will be a reduction. What would Cu¬≤‚Å∫ be reduced to? Sweeping more negatively gives another peak. What species would be reduced here? You can apply the same logic to oxidations (positive peaks) in the forward sweep.\n\n You can also get clues from where you are looking at the CV. If you are looking in a region of positive potential, that will be an oxidising environment, so you could expect to see peaks for reactions involving the most oxidised form of copper, and vice versa.\n\nAnother hint you get from CVs is in the shape of the peaks. Consider a reaction of A + e‚Åª ‚Üí B. If both species are in solution, you would expect the characteristic 'duck shape'. This is because the duck shape is created by diffusion controlled electrochemical reactions - the electrode was to 'wait' for more A to arrive before it can be reduced to B. \n\nHowever, if one species is in solution and the other is a solid, you would expect a very different peak shape. For example, in A(s) + e‚Åª ‚Üí B(aq) you don't have to wait for a A to arrive at the electrode, it's already stuck on the surface.

        # self.input_values(self.entry_list_q14) takes all of the values from the entry boxes that have been created, and assembles them in the same order they were created. This allows them to be checked one, by one against the list of answers
        # self.function_list_on_variable_list(answer_list_q14, self.values_list_q14) is a fairly convoluted way to get hold of all of the answers from the function(s) created by the user. The self.function_list_on_variable_list() part does the answer comparing and solving. Inside the brackets, the (answer_list_q14, self.values_list_q14) combines the list of functions and the list of values, so that each function takes the corresponding value to calculate the correct answer
        # This could certainly be done in a more Pythonic way, but the aim is to allow manipulation of the code by a novice user with minimal steps, which this hopefully achieves.

        question_q17 = "Question 17: Based on your answer to the previous question, a graph has been plotted. In order to accurately integrate the Cu‚Å∞ oxidation peak, it is first necessary to perform a background subtraction. The background subtraction is done by carrying out a linear fit to a region of the data that corresponds to the background signal. Use the two text boxes to enter in a lower and upper ùë° value that will be used to the linear fit. \n\n Hit Preview to see the linear fit and adjust as needed, then click submit when you are ready. \n\nHint: This worksheet has preset coded limits for where the baseline should be based on your lab script. To make sure you don't push these limits, it is better to choose a middle range for your baseline, rather than pushing the data range to its limit. If the worksheet says the range is incorrect, you may have miscalculated the time axis. The time range should be between 0 and ~ 350 s. Check with a demonstrator if unsure." ###Add in the text for the question you want to ask. The question has to be kept inside the quote marks for the code to work, e.g. "This is the text for my question"
        max_score_q17 = 2.0 ### Record the max score for this question

        feedback_q17 = ["When fitting the background for a peak, the linear fit is desigined to present a projection of how the background signal would look if it were to continue in a linear fashion underneath the peak. This should therefore be a fit of a linear region before the onset of the peak (i.e. to the left of the peak). \n\nNote that the question is asking what data range should be used to perform a linear fit that can be extrapolated to make a baseline. The data used to fit the baseline should therefore not contain any of the same data that makes up that peak. \n\nThe extrapolated baseline will not necessarily connect up the left and right hand side of the peak to be integrated, it is fine if it runs linearly underneath. \n\nMake sure that the linear region is relatively flat and confined to a resonable region of the plot. If you believe the region you have selected is ok, the selected region may just be too wide, so select a narrower window.\n\nFor the selection of the peak itself, use the change in colour to make sure that you are selecting the whole of the peak from the bottom to the top. The integration would only take part in the region that you select, so have you captured the entirity of the area under the peak?"]  ### Add in the message you want to pop up here, inside the quote marks after message =.

        # self.function_list_on_variable_list(answer_list_q17, self.values_list_q17) is a fairly convoluted way to get hold of all of the answers from the function(s) created by the user.
